    // function, to ensure your assumptions
    // on game state is correct.

  // Example of a later, more complex, test case:
  // Card handling

  // The HotStone specs are quite insisting on how
  // the cards, drawn from the deck, are organized
  // in the hand. So when drawing the top three cards
  // from the deck (uno, dos, tres) they have to
  // be organized in the hand as
  // index 0 = tres; index 1 = dos; index 2 = uno
  // That is, a newly drawn card is 'at the top'
  // of the hand - always entered at position 0
  // and pushing the rest of the cards 1 position
  // 'down'
  @Test
  public void shouldHaveUnoDosTresCardsInitially() {
    // Given a game, Findus has 3 cards in hand
    int count = game.getHandSize(Player.FINDUS);
    assertThat(count, is(3));
    // And these are ordered Tres, Dos, Uno in slot 0,1,2

    // When I pick card 0
    Card card = game.getCardInHand(Player.FINDUS, 0);
    // Then is it Tres
    // ENABLE TO START TDD'ing
    // assertThat(card.getName(), is(GameConstants.TRES_CARD));
